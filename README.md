Lost-in-Space
=============

Lost in Space is a simple game, destroy all the asteroids on each level and progress! Why? I have no idea, hence the title.

I'm not much of a game designer hence it's simplicity, this was originally intended as a submission for an assignment but I quite enjoyed making this game so I hope to expand it further. Lots of things to add and it certainly needs a lot of polishing too to improve how it looks. Basic functionality is there though.

Running the Game
----------------

There is no JAR file available for this, the only way to run it currently is to download the class files from the "out" folder and then run from command line. Main class is located in the package "xpilot" called "XPilotGame.class".

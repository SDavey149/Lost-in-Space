Lost-in-Space
=============

Lost in Space is a simple game, destroy all the asteroids on each level and progress! Why? I have no idea, hence the title.

I'm not much of a game designer hence it's simplicity, this was originally intended as a submission for an assignment but I quite enjoyed making this game so I hope to expand it further. Lots of things to add and it certainly needs a lot of polishing too to improve how it looks. Basic functionality is there though. 



TO-DO LIST
----------
* Change Ship drawing to something 'better looking'. 
* Change asteroid graphics to something 'better looking'.
* Clean up collision code, some objects have unnecessary code in their "hittable" methods.
* Add a main objective to the game.
* Add walls and other objects to the game.
* Improve Saucer AI - at the moment they're incredibly stupid. 
* Add wider range of powerups. 
* New sounds, especially for the ship so it doesn't sound like it's being propelled by farts.
